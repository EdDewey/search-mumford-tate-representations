We only look at them over $\\mathbb{C}$, which is a little silly since a lot of what makes Mumford-Tate groups interesting is their real structure, but there you are.\n",

    "Now that we have all representations we want to consider Hodge representations.  A Hodge representation of G is determined from a representation of G by choosing a Deligne torus in G, and the Hodge numbers of the representation can by evaluated by pairing all weights of the representation with the complexification of the real part of the Deligne torus (considered as a cocharacter of G).  In particular, if a representation is to underly a Hodge representation with fixed Hodge numbers, then for any maximal torus there must exist a cocharacter of the torus which  pairs with exactly h^{p,q} weights of the maximal torus on the alleged Hodge representation, to give p-q. And there are only finitely many cocharacters to check, since (in an irreducible representation) any nonzero cocharacter pairs nontrivially with some weight.  So for any representation (encoded as above) and any list of Hodge numbers, we can search for cocharacters producing those Hodge numbers)\n",

The false at the end of the funciton input says that we want to actually remember the cocharacters, not just check whether one exists.  Hodge numbers are specified as a dictionary, where the first number is p-q and the second is h^{p,q}."
